# My Answers to Perl by Example, 4th edition

This repository contains my answers to the exercices of the book "Perl
by Example, 4th edition" written by Ellie Quigley. I don't pretend
that I have the perfect solutions, nor that they are correct. I hope
these answers can help some people.

# A note about the version of Perl

This book was published in 2008. We're now in 2012 and Perl is
currently at version 5.16, so I adapted my answers to make them work
with version 5.16 without any errors or warnings.
